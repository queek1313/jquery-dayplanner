# jquery-dayplanner

This is a simple 8 hour day planner for a employee with a busy schedule.  When you open the browser you will see a basic hour to hour schedule that you can update each hour and save you data.  The planner will update its color based on the time of the day and will show grey for time past, red for current hour and green for future time.

There is a save button next to each hour to save the data to local storage.  This data will be displayed even if the browser is reloaded.
